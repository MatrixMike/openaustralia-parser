                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Another talented Territorian making headlines at the moment is 14-year-old Dripstone High School student Shiane Hawke. Shiane is a finalist on the TV show the <span style="font-style:italic;">X F</span><span style="font-style:italic;">actor</span> and she has the most amazingly powerful voice and certainly surprised everyone, including all the judges, when she sang Duffy's song 'Mercy' during the audition. She continues to surprise Australians with her talent. I know that every time I hear her voice I get goosebumps. We Territorians know that Shiane does have the X factor, and recently I spoke to Shiane's mother, Mary, who is obviously very proud of Shiane, as we all are. I have it on very good authority that Shiane has the most amazing strength and determination, and, like many Territorians, has an easy-going laid-back attitude. And that is what sets us apart from the rest of Australia. I have to agree with Ronan Keating, who is an expert in this field, when he says Shiane is truly gifted. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than having the opportunity to boast right here in this place about talented young, up-and-coming stars in my electorate.</span>

This share component can really only come from two rivers, and that is the Border and the Namoi. The others are all terminal streams that go into wetland and only on very rare occasions flow—indeed for the Lachlan it is once in 100 years that the Lachlan flows through to the Darling. I am terribly concerned about the cuts that may be coming towards the Namoi and Border Rivers, considering that these communities have been in water restructure mode now for the last 20 years. This Murray Darling Basin plan is not something of recent times. In many of the basins this is the fourth lot of reconstruction that we have seen with water users. </span>

We have been able to work as a government with my local communities and the state government to open up the waterways for social amenity. I would like to congratulate the Wynyard-Waratah Council. For example, at Somerset near the Cam River they have enhanced the foreshore to the surf club plus introduced a shared pathway and recreational fitness equipment.

I want to congratulate a number of our councils on what I call restoring our waterways to the community and to the people. We have been able to work as a government with my local communities and the state government to open up the waterways for social amenity. I would like to congratulate the Wynyard-Waratah Council. For example, at Somerset near the Cam River they have enhanced the foreshore to the surf club plus introduced a shared pathway and recreational fitness equipment. Then at beautiful Wynyard itself the enhancement of the wharf precinct is absolutely superb and now there is a magnificent walking track all the way through the Gutteridge Gardens all the way round to Fossil Bluff.</span>

I congratulate them very much. We were able to assist with a new rail bridge, shared pathways all the way through to Cooee, the Makers' Workshop, the West Park recreation centre and the surf club. The whole precinct itself is absolutely beautiful.</span>

Graffiti is an issue that generates widespread community concern and can have a negative impact on community perceptions of safety and public amenity.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though graffiti is considered by some as a petty crime, there is a substantial cost to the community, both socially and economically, and it breeds a criminal culture. Estimations on the cost of graffiti across Australia are of $1.5 billion annually. When communities and local businesses discover they have been the target of graffiti they feel anger, shock and fear. Sadly, each year there is a terrible cost for families and communities when young people are accidentally killed while engaged in the application of graffiti to train carriages or to the rail corridor.</span>

In those capacities, I have seen on the ground on many occasions what these brave men and women have done in Australia's name in Afghanistan. We went there in the first place to deny al-Qaeda a safe operating base in that country—a base from which they launched the September 11 attacks which brought about such bloodshed in the United States. We are there also to train an entire brigade of the Afghan National Army so that they can look after their own defence—a task we are about to complete. And we are there to make the province that we have been given responsibility for as governable as possible for the local administration once we leave, to make it as hard as possible therefore for al-Qaeda to return. As these missions are completed, our troops will be coming home—most of them during the course of next year.</span>

They came from all parts of my electorate and were delighted when they heard the Prime Minister announce that the government was moving forward with the scheme, beginning with trials in various parts of the nation and in Victoria—in particular, in Geelong and Barwon. Then followed representations to me from various groups anxious to know more and to find out how they could be part of that process.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1979 there was also an inquiry into public duty and private interest. It reported in July 1979 and recommended a code of conduct be implemented for office holders, including members of parliament. A regime for the registration of interests of members, which we all subscribe to here, was implemented in 1984 following it. It was not until 1991 that the then Prime Minister proposed a working group of parliamentarians be established to develop a seminar on the standards of conduct. Then the presiding officers reconvened a working group in the 37th Parliament and looked at that issue. It was 1996 when, if I remember correctly, Prime Minister John Howard implemented some sort of code for ministers. Then in 2007 Prime Minister Rudd introduced new standards of ministerial ethics. In parliament it was 2008 in the Main Committee where there was an exchange that gave rise to consideration of this issue. Then there was a certain incident, referred to in the report, within the parliamentary precincts that caused the Speaker to refer the incident to the committee. There was then discussion about that. With the 43rd Parliament there were certain agreements around this particular issue, and in November 2010 the House referred to the committee the development of a draft code of conduct for members of parliament. I note that, when the committee considered this, they did not make a finding or express a view on the threshold issue of whether a code of conduct should be adopted or not but they did set out a series of things, and one of them was appendix 5, a draft code of conduct for members of the House of Representatives. That is what the motion of the honourable member for Lyne refers to. So they do have a draft code there.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just talk in broad terms. We know the report has been delivered to the parliament. This committee examined a member's code of conduct and they examined it on the basis that the parliament could not deal with members whose behaviour was deemed unacceptable. The British model, on which we base much of our system, gave us evidence. This was done in response to the misuse of entitlements by British MPs. It is quite well known what the British MPs did in terms of misusing their entitlements to houses and all the other things. They went to court. They lost their seats. But a huge bureaucracy was set up—and this is what the member for Lyne, in this motion, wants to do to us—set up a huge bureaucracy attached to this House, which would then go on a fishing expedition for nefarious or otherwise behaviour of MPs. And the evidence given by the British MPs was that many of the complaints of the electorate against MPs was not for behaviour unbecoming but for things like not replying to letters or not giving satisfactory answers, or not being responsive enough. This huge bureaucracy was set up and of course when you set up this bureaucracy it then goes looking for work. </span>

The then chair, and now Deputy Speaker, Anna Burke did a marvellous job in ensuring that we took into consideration not only the views of members of Parliament—and the roundtable was very, very important—but also the broader community.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we need to be clear what the question is that we are considering as we debate this motion. The question is not whether it is a good and desirable idea that members of parliament maintain high standards of personal conduct. Of course, that is a highly desirable objective and all members of parliament ought to be seeking to do that whether there is a code in existence or not. The question before the House this morning is not whether there is, at least as a matter of theory, merit in a code of conduct which parliamentarians are required to subscribe to. I think we can all agree with the proposition that at least in theory there could be merit in such a code, although I would note that the particular code or the particular draft code which is attached to the relevant report of the House of Representatives standing committee is not necessarily the code which is the one that should be argued to be supported. But I think we can agree that, at least in theory, there could be merit in the notion of a code.</span>

As we approach the warmer months and many Australians flock to our beaches, I want also to be able to assure our professional and volunteer patrol men and women that they have the complete, bipartisan support of the Australian parliament and to assure each and every one of the more than 44,000 patrolling members and the 160,000 or so total adult membership that their efforts are not being taken for granted. I also want to take the chance to highlight the opportunities for governments to work in partnership with this very successful movement to achieve even better outcomes in the future. We have every reason in this place and throughout the Australian community to be very proud of the history of the surf lifesaving movement. Any discussion of the surf lifesaving movement should recognise its remarkable history in this nation, because it dates right back to the early days of the 20th century. As Australian bathing laws were relaxed and there was increased activity on our beaches, concerns were concerns raised about safety. So much so that in October 1907 the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales was formed, and that was the forerunner of the Surf Life Saving Australia movement.</span>

Earlier this year I was very pleased to open with the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister our surfing centre of excellence, which is the world's first. Our federal Labor government committed $2 million to this outstanding project. To have it at Casuarina on the North Coast in my electorate shows what a strong surfing community we have there, and indeed we are very proud to have the world's first surfing centre of excellence as well.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">I am honoured to represent some of the oldest surf clubs in Australia, in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, and, indeed, the oldest surf club in Australia. However, it would be a controversial statement for me to say which of the several claimants to be the oldest surf club was indeed the oldest surf club. Bronte surf club has a very good claim to have been founded in 1903, although we note that the first recorded minutes of its meeting are in 1907—although the minutes claim to be the fourth meeting, so presumably it was founded in 1903—and lifesaving training began at Bronte in the late 19th century, in fact, modelled on English lifesaving techniques. Also of course there is my own club, founded in 1906: North Bondi surf club. Bondi surf club, which is the club in the middle of the beach—or Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club, to give it its full name—also lays claim to being the oldest club, but it was founded in 1907. Tamarama was founded in 1904, and, just south of the electorate, literally just on the other side of the boundary, is the Clovelly club, founded in 1904, and Coogee, founded in 1907. So surf lifesaving began really in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney in the early years of the 20th century, but the mists of time, and the tact required to be the local member, requires me not to go any further into resolving the controversy. I can only say that my own club does not claim to be the oldest club, so I am quite impartial about it.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Beach and surf lifesaving is a part of the Australian identity. Over the last two centuries, the Australian bush has been central to the way Australians have viewed themselves, yet the images of rolling waves, white beaches, families soaking up the sun and surfers now have the most resonance. These are, without doubt, very much at the heart of how we are and how we are seen by others. Australia has 11,000 beaches and 37,000 kilometres of coastline. The vast majority of Australia's population lives in cities or towns near or on the coast. The beach is, and always has been, the place where millions of Australians escape to relax, swim and play. Surfing and the beach brings together a diverse range of people—and I agree with the member for Wentworth. Unlike other places around the world, we do not have privately owned beaches. In Australia, the beach is a public place. With a long history and tradition, the surf lifesaver has a unique role in Australia's culture—to save lives and to prevent injuries. For people who visit our beaches their role is essential.</span>

Police remembrance is observed annually on St Michael's Day—St Michael being the patron saint of law enforcement. It is one of the most significant days in the national police calendar. It is a day that we join with our police throughout the country in remembering and honouring those whose lives were tragically cut short in the line of duty. This year, sadly, we remember Senior Constable David James Rixon, who was tragically shot and killed in Tamworth on 2 March this year while conducting a routine traffic stop. Senior Constable Rixon was the only officer killed on duty this year, but his death is one too many. Today, I am wearing a blue and white tie that was struck in honour of Senior Constable Rixon by the Oxley Highway Patrol and the Tamworth Local Area Command. Senior Constable Rixon joined the New South Wales Police at aged 19. During his course of service, he was awarded the Police Medal, the National Medal and the first and second clasps. Only days after his tragic death, Commissioner Scipione presented his wife, Fiona Rixon, with three posthumous awards: the Commissioner's Valour Award for conspicuous merit and exceptional bravery while under fire, the Commissioner's Sesquicentenary Citation and the National Police Service Medal.</span>

We are forever in their debt. We also remember the loved ones left behind, those whose lives have been affected forever with the passing of a partner, a father, mother, brother or sister. We owe it to the fallen to look after their families and, in that respect, I pay particular regard to the efforts and commitment of Police Legacy.</span>

My city has a very good relationship with the Queensland Police Service. In fact, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin</span> awards a special copper every year with its <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin</span> North Queensland Police Officer of the Year Award. This year it was won by Detective Sergeant Mark Hogenelst from Charters Towers. I only met him briefly to congratulate him, but he must be a super bloke and a great copper. He beat Senior Sergeant John Tantalo from Halifax Police Station and Brad Gough from Deeragun and Rollingstone police stations. I know Brad mainly by reputation. If he is not having his head shaved for a cure, he is running raffles at the Rollingstone pub, raising money for some community and, in particular, the Rollingstone and Mutarnee state schools. All this is done on his days off. He, like so many of our police men and women, has been in the service for a long time. Brad has over 30 years of service. The previous winner of this award was from Palm Island. So being a policeman is not just a big city job; it is a regional and rural job as well and they take their job all over the place.</span>

Let me briefly run through the main components of this bill. First, it will improve and update Australia's privacy law framework. Through these measures, it will create a single set of privacy principles that will be technology neutral for both the private sector and Australian government agencies. It will introduce a new, more comprehensive consumer-credit-reporting system. It will clarify and enhance the powers of the Privacy Commissioner, to advance the commissioner's ability to resolve complaints and to undertake investigations. It will also promote privacy compliance.</span>

I think one of the other important parts of the bill, as I was saying before about direct marketing materials, is that the bill also provides for a new privacy principle which will more tightly regulate the use of personal information for direct marketing. It will give more powers to consumers to opt out of receiving direct marketing materials, companies will have to have clear and simple ways of opting out and the statement from the company must be prominent. I think that is something a lot of consumers in my electorate will welcome. I also think extending privacy protections to unsolicited information is important, as are clearer rules around data quality and data correction.</span>

As a spectacle, the final of the men's 5,000 metre wheelchair race was up there with anything in the Olympics, with Australian legend Kurt Fearnley just missing out on a gold medal. I had the privilege of being involved in two medal ceremonies at the aquatic centre, including one of the gold medal ceremonies for Australian golden girl of the pool, Jacquie Freney. Jacquie won eight gold medals at the games, making her the most successful athlete at a single Paralympics.

The Rollers made it all the way to the gold-medal match, along the way beating the United States. They narrowly lost the final to Canada, but the team and Bill can be immensely proud having won a silver medal. Unfortunately not every Australian athlete could bring home a medal, but in my mind, every Australian Paralympian is a champion, regardless of their result in London. Each of these athletes has overcome extraordinary adversity to reach the highest levels of elite sport. Baron de Coubertin's Olympic Creed is a timely reminder that sport is not always about winning, and he said:</span>

Pilot rider Stephanie and her cycling partner Felicity Johnson set a Paralympic record by winning the tandem one-kilometre time trial. Stephanie has achieved significant success as an individual cyclist but she decided to ride and support her partner Felicity Johnson, who is legally blind, at the recent Paralympic Games.

Colin finished sixth with his team mates Jonathon Harris and Stephen Churm, not as good as their performance in Beijing, but nonetheless a magnificent achievement of which they can be proud. Sailing had been a long held passion for Colin but after he lost his right arm to cancer he momentarily gave up the sport before deciding to continue. He went on to compete for his nation.

When asked by a local paper how she was going to manage the year-12 study workload and training for the Paralympics, Rachel replied, 'I have been able to hone my time management skills and I am a pretty good planner.' Rachael is one determined young woman. In London, Rachael competed in the women's 100-metre T35 and the women's 200-metre T35.

The ad starts with the very moving images of athletes with disabilities coming from all the way across the country ready to compete in those games. They are beautifully shot images, some very hard images of some incredible athletes. Halfway through the ad, you suddenly get very quick flashes of a car accident, a bomb in possibly Afghanistan, of a foetus in a womb—all highlighting really easily just how some of these disabilities have been acquired, and highlighting for people who see the ad that this could be anybody. The ad finishes, if anybody has not seen it, with these amazing scenes of athletes competing, and literally says, 'Meet the superhumans'.

While I am a great fan and supporter of Olympians and the great work they do as tremendous sportspeople, I think it takes a very special kind of person to have a setback either through injury or from birth and be able to gather the wherewithal to make themselves into the kind of sportsperson who can represent their country and either win medals or compete in the Paralympics.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a very proud record at the Paralympics. Governments of all persuasion—Liberal, coalition and Labor—have supported Paralympic teams. I want to take this opportunity to place on record some of the achievements of people from my own electorate of Sturt, and one in particular, who competed in these games in London. There were three Paralympians from my electorate: Felicity Johnson, Libby Kosmala and Esther Overton.</span>

A total of 4,294 athletes from 164 countries took part in 503 events in 20 sports during these games, with Australia sending a total of 304 athletes. This was the largest team we have ever fielded and our representatives did us proud by achieving excellent results. Australia finished fifth on the final medal tally board with 32 gold, 23 silver and 28 bronze medals. Of the 13 sports Australian athletes contested in London, medals were won in nine. This included Australia's first ever medal in hand cycling and the swimming team won more than half the gold medals on offer. The president of the Australian Paralympic Committee, Greg Hartung, was full of praise, saying that the performance of the Australian Paralympic team at the London 2012 Paralympic Games had exceeded all expectations. </span>

It was the first premiership team for that club, the Kangaroos, since the late 1950s, and I know that they are still celebrating that great achievement. The Governor-General was in town on the weekend for an event, but I think her being there, whilst it was celebrated, was probably drowned out in the din that the local Aussie Rules team made over winning that wonderful flag.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, I would like to place on the record some of the efforts of two Paralympians from my electorate of Forde. The first is an Indigenous Marsden State High School student, Torita Isaac, and the other is Bill Latham. Torita is only 17 years old and suffers from cerebral palsy and vision impairment. She was part of our Paralympic athletics squad, placing seventh in the 100-metre sprint and also in the 200-metre sprint, and she finished fourth as a member of the four-by-four 100-metre relay team. Torita first tried athletics at school, where she competed in cross-country competitions with her friends. Torita looks up to the famous Olympians like Cathy Freeman and Sally Pearson.</span>

                   <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become apparent in recent times that there are a number of problems with the industrial relations system in this country. In the context of the amendments to the Fair Work Act, which will hopefully flow when the government responds to the independent review, it will provide us with a great opportunity to fix some of those problems. That is what this bill will do. Firstly, one of the problems that we noticed, especially in my home state of Victoria, is that we have disputes in the public sector that are being unnecessarily prolonged by powerful employers who—certainly, according to leaked cabinet documents—when it came to the nurses in Victoria, said that their strategy was to hold out in the negotiations, provoke the nurses into taking industrial action and then hope that, when the matter went to Fair Work Australia, it would be resolved on favourable terms because, under the laws as they currently stand, there are some matters, like nurse-patient ratios, that cannot be arbitrated by the independent umpire.</span>

The theme this year is 'Brain health: making the connections.'</span>

Many challenges come with improved health and life expectancy outcomes, including rising health and care costs and declining workforce participation. The IMF indicates the life expectancy of Australians aged 60 is increasing at the rate of nine years every half-century. The life expectancy of 80-year-olds has risen by three years since the 1970s. As our population ages, so too grows the number of people in our nation living with dementia.</span>

According to statistics provided by Alzheimer's Australia, almost 280,000 Australians currently live with dementia. Without a significant medical breakthrough, that is expected to soar to almost one million people by 2050. Each week there are 1,600 new cases of dementia in Australia, and that is expected to grow to 7,400 new diagnoses each week by 2050. Dementia is the third leading cause of death in Australia after heart disease and stroke. The total estimated worldwide cost of dementia is US$604 billion in 2010, and this cost accounts for about one per cent of the world's gross domestic product. Australia faces a shortage of more than 150,000 paid and unpaid carers for people with dementia by 2029. The cost of replacing all family carers with paid carers is estimated to be $5.5 billion per annum.</span>

It is therefore timely for us to recognise that where fighting dementia is concerned there is always more work to be done. Individuals suffering from dementia and their family and friends deserve our recognition and support. I have to thank the member for Newcastle because it was an event she was at in 2009 that got me talking about the issue, and it was a hard issue to talk about. But it is important to talk about Alzheimer's and the effect it has and that unfortunately it does not discriminate in relation to age: at that Alzheimer's event I indicated that my mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the age of 56, and she has since passed away. We need to provide support, we need to invest in research and we need to keep the work going. We need support to help loved ones to stay at home and continue to integrate with their community where possible and support within hospital and aged-care facilities where that is the necessary next step.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">The behavioural changes that take place can be very, very dramatic for people who have dementia. It can be very distressing for the person involved and very confronting for the family members who take care of them. Things like hoarding, repetitive behaviour and, unfortunately, aggression, can be really upsetting, and no-one wants to see their mum or their dad or their grandparents or other relatives in that state of distress. We know that more Australians than ever are being diagnosed with dementia and having to come to terms with the challenges that a diagnosis presents. It is great today, as I said, that we can take a few moments to focus on this issue and think about how we can best try and help the nation to cope with the prospect of 7,400 new cases every week. There is a lot of work being done currently on dementia. I would like to also acknowledge the members of my House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing who are here: the deputy chair, the member for Swan, and the member for Shortland, Jill Hall. They have both been involved in the inquiry that we are currently conducting. There will be more said about that as the report comes out later in the year.</span>

It is always distressing for relatives to see the decline, sometimes gradual and sometimes rapid, of their loved ones, and we know that there are many tough decisions to be made in terms of arranging care. This situation has touched my own family recently with my mother being placed in a dementia ward in Victoria, down in Melbourne. To see the degradation in her mental faculties, in her mind, has been concerning to the whole family. But we know she is in a place which is very caring and that is looking after her. Whenever I get the chance I take the opportunity to visit her. It has been lucky that the health and ageing committee has had quite a few hearings in Melbourne, so I have been able to pop down and see her.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">People ask what a stroke is. It is not a heart attack—it is a condition that affects the brain. It is the second biggest killer in Australia. A stroke happens when the supply of blood to the brain is suddenly interrupted. Blood is carried to the brain through blood vessels, called arteries, and if one of those blood vessels gets blocked the blood does not flow to the brain. It could be through a clot or plaque, or it could happen if the artery bursts. A stroke can be very debilitating, and strokes affect one in six people. It is important that people know about stroke, understand the risk factors and know who it affects.</span>

A stroke can happen in two ways: either there is a blood clot or plaque that blocks a blood vessel in the brain, or an aneurysm—that is, a blood vessel in the brain that breaks or ruptures. They create a starvation of the arteries that feed the brain the blood and the oxygen it requires.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that one in every six people in Australia will suffer a stroke. It now has become Australia's second-biggest killer and a leading cause of disability amongst adults but also amongst young people. Despite this, most people prefer to believe that stroke is something that happens to other people and, alarmingly, are unaware of potentially life-saving warning signs. If we stop to think about the number of people we know personally or know of who have had a stroke—anyone from members of our family to friends and the broader neighbourhood or, indeed, to our own constituencies—I think we would realise just how vulnerable we all are, especially given the odds that I have just mentioned.</span>

They also tell us about six steps we can take to reduce our risk of stroke, which I will read. They are to do with lifestyle.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and the risk of having a stroke. While there are lifestyle risk factors we can control, including our level of exercise, our weight and whether we drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, we cannot control our age, our gender or our family history. Importantly, many thousands of Australians suffer from transient ischaemic attacks known as minor strokes or ministrokes, after which the symptoms generally subside within 24 hours. These transient symptoms are often ignored, although we know that one in five people who have a TIA can suffer a major stroke within three months. These figures highlight the very pressing need for all Australians to check with their GP about their heart health and to assess their risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke.</span>

Something must be done to stop the bloodshed, to stop the displacement and work towards a long-lasting, sustainable peace. I strongly believe that the international community has a responsibility to foster peace in the region. I believe that Australia as a good international citizen has a responsibility to do all we can to empower the peacemakers and help to end this suffering.

We joined with the United States of America and other members of the international community in urging all parties to remain committed to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In April this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that the government is providing up to 25 Australian Defence Force personnel and 10 Australian Federal Police to the United Nations Mission in the Republic of  South Sudan, to provide ongoing humanitarian and development assistance to South Sudan. </span>

I had not even begun to understand the lives that some of them had led when I was talking to one young man who was telling me of some advice his mother gave him. When I was young my mum gave me advice when I ate too much, that if I got a tummy ache and stuck my finger in my bellybutton it would make the tummy ache go away. That is what she told me. Well, this young man's mum had told him if he did not eat for five days he would grow really tall. Can you imagine in an Australian context a mum being in the position where she had to make up a story like that, to make it acceptable for her son that he was not going to eat for five days? It is a world that most of us in Australia simply could not imagine. He still believed it, by the way. His mum told him and he still believed it. He was in his 30s, I think, and he still believed what his mum told him. He thought that was why he was so tall. So that was a sign of great love from a mum.

They are people of great resilience who have arrived in this country with appalling stories in their lives who have knuckled down to build a life here with such incredible commitment. They are people who give back to their own community in the most extraordinary ways. A young man I know who arrived at 18 with four younger brothers and sisters put himself through law school and his four younger brothers and sisters through high school and university. All that time, from the first year, he set up community organisations to work with other youth, as if he did not have enough of his own to do. Right from the beginning, he had this incredible commitment to making life work in this new country. These are extraordinary people from both South Sudan and Sudan—people that a country should be proud of; people capable of building great countries if they have peace; people capable of making real contributions not only to their own country but to the world. For this reason as well, we really should argue very, very strongly as a government for an end to this conflict.</span>

I had a friend who worked with the government of South Sudan's liaison office in Australia. They asked me for some assistance, and I worked with them by helping them with access to meetings with various departments and agencies, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID. I helped them with contact with the Australian Electoral Commission and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the like in the lead-up to the new state coming into being. In addition, to formalise things, they had to set up a bank account. We might think that is easy, but it was not straightforward. There were a whole lot of formalities that had to happen around that because they are receiving public moneys and the like. I was able to assist them with that in a small way.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout history polio has been one of the greatest causes of disability and still today there is no cure. Major polio epidemics first began to occur in Europe in the 1880s and soon spread to the United States of America. By 1910, epidemics were becoming regular across the developed world, typically during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio was paralysing or killing more than half a million people worldwide every year. Over the past 30 years global collaboration has reduced cases by 99 per cent. In 1988 there were more than 350,000 cases of polio throughout the world. In 2011 there were just 650 and the number of polio endemic countries had been reduced from 125 to three. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative advises that, in the past six months, there have been 92 cases of polio throughout the world—63 cases in Nigeria, 15 in Pakistan, 12 in Afghanistan and two in Chad.</span>

Australians are paying $20 million every single day just on Labor's interest repayments on its net $145 billion of debt—which only grows as Labor racks up more deficit. The idea that somehow they will deliver a surplus this year is laughable. I know many people find it hard to recognise the difference between a million and a billion and what effect it has. I like to say to people, look at it this way: a million seconds is about 12 days but a billion seconds is 34 years. I think we all realise there is a lot of difference between 12 days and 34 years. We have a government that seems to be addicted to debt and that is continually running up that debt. We have no expectation of a surplus in this financial year, and I think MYEFO will prove that later in the year. </span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward nearly a century to the suburb of Rochedale on the southern outskirts of my electorate of Bonner. Rochedale was for many years an important salad bowl district supplying the Rocklea Markets with fresh fruit and vegetables. During the Second World War years, Rochedale farmers supplied their produce to the large Army encampment at Coopers Plains. Until the 1990s small farmers on 10-acre blocks could make a reasonable living, but with the growth in Brisbane's population and the rise in land values and farming costs these smallholdings have sometimes become untenable. Bigger farms in regional areas can produce large amounts of food on an economy-of-scale basis. The Rochedale Urban Village residential development, an initiative of the Brisbane City Council, has resulted in many such farms being sold, and the suburb is now undergoing rapid change from small farms to small allotments. As a result, many of the old farmers are moving on and the new homeowners are moving in. The demographic is changing.</span>

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">It is claimed that energy drinks help boost energy levels substantially and keep individuals alert and active for longer periods than usual. The drinks are targeted largely at teenagers and young adults, and are readily available in grocery stores, local shops, vending machines, pubs and clubs. What is most worrying to me, however, is that they are being sold in cans or large bottles, up to 1.25 litres, and marketed towards young people. While the products are often promoted as relatively harmless drinks, in reality energy drinks can be quite harmful when consumed regularly. Studies have shown that consumption of energy drinks over an extended period can result in problems such as elevated blood pressure, increasing anxiety levels, insomnia and heart palpitations. </span>

Almost uniquely in the developed world at the time, Australia had a relatively high interest rate. We were fortunate enough to have the working room for reductions in interest rates—reductions that would have had a similar effect to additional  stimulus—and Australians paying less interest on their home loans would have been left more money to spend boosting our economy. This would have obviated the necessity for massive borrowings, massive debt and massive, massive repayments. But the intellects opposite, those who campaigned as fiscal conservatives in both the 2007 and 2010 elections, decided on more and more stimulus, resulting in God knows how many botched projects and programs, and government borrowing crowding the market and putting upward pressure on interest rates—and those projects and programs!</span>

What we really need is sensible expenditure and careful management of our economy—and we do need savings, but they should be savings for the purposes of spending that money for the benefit of our country. Barry O'Farrell has made it extremely clear with this $1.7 billion cut that he has chosen to put school and TAFE students last. Their voices are not loud enough. Their needs are not great enough. Their capacity to build the future is not seductive enough for him to want to invest in our young people. That message is completely different from what we stand for on the Labor side.</span>
