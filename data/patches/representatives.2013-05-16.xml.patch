What is interesting is that the photo had the largest number of hits of any posted. This indicates to me that the decisions of the O'Farrell government in relation to staffing are of vital importance to many people. The New South Wales government is closing down fire stations and not replacing firefighters who are sick or on leave. In fact, Revesby joins Riverwood and Mortdale fire stations, also in my electorate, with other fire stations that have been closed arbitrarily. If a house is burning and the fire truck takes 30 minutes to arrive instead of 10 because the nearby station is shut, it may mean the difference between life and death.

                 <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts have also been made to the Rural Fire Service. In late 2012 it was revealed the O'Farrell government planned to slash $12 million from employee expenses at the RFS and cut 120 jobs. These cuts come on top of $64 million cut from the New South Wales Fire Brigade, forcing local fire stations to temporarily close their doors when firefighters call in sick. These cuts to firefighters come on top of 3,600 jobs to go from hospitals and ambulance stations 2,400 jobs cut from schools and TAFE colleges and almost 1,000 job cuts in community services. This is in addition to job cuts at Sydney Water, Roads and Maritime Services, Office of Environment and Heritage, Forests NSW, RailCorp and in many other government departments further job losses are anticipated. </span>

                     </a>  No, I won't take a question, Member for Moreton, so sit yourself down and find a way to explain to your constituents why, in six years, you have done nothing for the veterans of our country. In 2009, it was 'the highest priority to address the issue of military justice.' It was the highest priority to index military pensions. Nothing was done in six years. Do you know what another highest priority was, Mr Deputy Speaker? Defence of the realm and national security were the highest priority. Prime Minister Rudd issued the first national security statement and promised that every single year he would update that. He never updated it, and the current Prime Minister has done one. We have had two in six years—and national security is the 'highest priority'. In fact, national security is of such a high priority that the current Prime Minister would not attend the National Security Committee of cabinet; she would send her bodyguard. That is how much 'high priority' the Prime Minister puts on national security.</span>

                     </a>  In fact it is not a tax. It is a price on carbon and I am simply referring to the expression which you used, which is manifestly incorrect. In fact, the government has moved to link the carbon price with the carbon price being applied by close to 50 European countries. We will have exactly the same price as those 50 European countries, so it is simply absurd to run out the tired old chestnut that we are applying the world's highest carbon price.</span>

                     </a>  It is manifestly untrue.  Small- and medium-sized enterprises are indeed the engine room of job creation in this country and they will be the big winners following passage of this bill. In September 2011 the government commissioned the Productivity Commission to review Australia's export credit arrangements. Our response to the Productivity Commission's review, which was announced earlier this year, set out some adjustments to the mandate, the powers and the governance and financial arrangements of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This bill implements those changes.</span>
